## Purity Violations

The following nodes exceed 100 lines and need handler extraction:

- **intelligence_adapter**: 2,095 lines (file: `src/omniintelligence/nodes/intelligence_adapter/node_intelligence_adapter_effect.py`)

### Why This Matters

ONEX nodes should be 'pure shells' that delegate all business logic to handler modules. This ensures:
- Testability: Handlers can be unit tested in isolation
- Reusability: Handlers can be shared across nodes
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
- Contract compliance: Node shells focus on I/O, handlers on logic

## Missing Node Files

The following node directories don't have a `node.py` file:

- **pattern_assembler_compute**: Check `__init__.py` for stub/model-only definition

## Recommendations

1. **Extract handlers from large nodes**: The nodes listed in Purity Violations should have their business logic moved to `handlers/` directories. This follows the ONEX pattern of 'pure shell' nodes.
2. **Implement stub nodes**: 8/12 nodes are stubs. Prioritize implementing nodes based on operational requirements.

## Legend

- **Pure Shell**: Node with <100 lines that delegates to base class
- **Stub**: Node marked with `is_stub: ClassVar[bool] = True`
- **Needs Handler Extraction**: Node with >100 lines requiring refactoring
- **Handlers**: Whether `handlers/` directory exists
- **Contract**: Whether `contract.yaml` exists
- **Models**: Whether `models/` directory or `models.py` exists
