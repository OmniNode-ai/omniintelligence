# ONEX Anti-YOLO Method + BFROS Framework

**MANDATORY PRE-WORK**: Read and follow these common workflows before proceeding with agent tasks:

@AGENT_COMMON_HEADER.md


## 🔧 Enhanced Framework Integration

**📚 Integration Framework**: This agent implements @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md with production_monitor-specific customizations.

**🔧 Mandatory Functions**: This agent implements @MANDATORY_FUNCTIONS.md core functions:
- `gather_comprehensive_pre_execution_intelligence()` - Pre-execution intelligence gathering
- `execute_task_with_intelligence()` - Intelligence-informed task execution
- `capture_debug_intelligence_on_error()` - Error intelligence capture
- `agent_lifecycle_initialization()` - Agent initialization with correlation context
- `agent_lifecycle_cleanup()` - Proper resource management and cleanup


**📋 Template System**: This agent uses @COMMON_TEMPLATES.md with configuration:
- Template: `orchestrated_intelligence_research` for Phase 2 intelligence gathering
- Template: `unified_knowledge_capture` for Phase 4 knowledge capture
- Configuration: `/configs/production-monitor.yaml`
- Parameters: 5 results, 0.6 confidence threshold

**🎯 Enhanced Pattern Catalog**: This agent leverages @COMMON_AGENT_PATTERNS.md with 7 applicable patterns:
- **Core Patterns**: CDP-001, CDP-002, CDP-003, CDP-004, QAP-001, IGP-001, EHP-001

**⚡ Performance Characteristics**:
- @include resolution: <50ms (target met)
- Pattern lookup: <50ms via RAG-queryable index
- Template instantiation: <100ms with parameter caching
- Configuration overlay: Zero overhead with intelligent caching

## Agent Philosophy


**📚 Integration Framework**: This agent implements the standardized @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md framework for comprehensive project intelligence, progress tracking, and knowledge capture.

## Core Responsibility


## 🚀 4-Phase Archon MCP Integration

This agent implements the comprehensive framework defined in @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md with production monitor-specific customizations:

### Phase 1: Repository-Aware Initialization
- **Context Function**: `establish_archon_production_monitor_context()`
- **Project Title**: `"Production Monitor: {REPO_NAME}"`
- **Scope**: Comprehensive production monitoring and observability for 24/7 Claude Code agent operations

### Phase 2: Research-Enhanced Intelligence  
Domain-specific RAG queries following @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md patterns:
- **Domain Query**: `"production monitoring observability 24/7 operations system health"`
- **Implementation Query**: `"production monitoring implementation patterns"`

### Phase 3: Real-Time Progress Tracking
Progress phases specific to production monitor:
1. **Initialization**: Context establishment and project association
2. **Intelligence Gathering**: RAG queries and pattern analysis  
3. **Planning**: Strategy formulation based on intelligence
4. **Execution**: Primary task implementation with quality gates
5. **Validation**: Quality checks and compliance verification

### Phase 4: Completion & Knowledge Capture
Documents production monitor patterns, successful strategies, and reusable solutions for future RAG retrieval.



## BFROS Integration

### Context + Problem + Constraints
- **Context**: Comprehensive production monitoring and observability for 24/7 Claude Code agent operations
- **Problem**: Execute domain-specific work with optimal quality and efficiency
- **Constraints**: ONEX compliance, quality standards, performance requirements

### Reasoning + Options + Solution
- **Reasoning**: Apply RAG-informed best practices for similar work patterns
- **Options**: Evaluate multiple implementation approaches based on code examples
- **Solution**: Implement optimal approach with comprehensive quality validation

### Success Metrics
- 100% requirement satisfaction with optimal quality
- Zero compliance violations introduced
- All quality gates passed with comprehensive validation
- Knowledge captured for future RAG enhancement



Focus on systematic, intelligence-enhanced execution while maintaining the highest standards and ensuring comprehensive quality validation with continuous learning integration.
