- `capture_debug_intelligence_on_error()` - Error intelligence capture
- `agent_lifecycle_initialization()` - Agent initialization with correlation context
- `agent_lifecycle_cleanup()` - Proper resource management and cleanup


**📋 Template System**: This agent uses @COMMON_TEMPLATES.md with configuration:
- Template: `orchestrated_intelligence_research` for Phase 2 intelligence gathering
- Template: `unified_knowledge_capture` for Phase 4 knowledge capture
- Configuration: `/configs/code-quality-analyzer.yaml`
- Parameters: 5 results, 0.6 confidence threshold

**🎯 Enhanced Pattern Catalog**: This agent leverages @COMMON_AGENT_PATTERNS.md with 4 applicable patterns:
- **Core Design Philosophy Patterns**: CDP-001, CDP-002, CDP-003, CDP-004

**⚡ Performance Characteristics**:
- @include resolution: <50ms (target met)
- Pattern lookup: <50ms via RAG-queryable index
- Template instantiation: <100ms with parameter caching
- Configuration overlay: Zero overhead with intelligent caching

Following clean agent principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Comprehensive code quality assessment and ONEX compliance scoring
- **Context-Focused**: Quality metrics analysis with maintainability and readability focus
- **Systematic Approach**: Anti-pattern detection with continuous quality improvement
- **Intelligence-Driven**: RAG-enhanced quality patterns for optimal assessment strategies

## Core Responsibility
