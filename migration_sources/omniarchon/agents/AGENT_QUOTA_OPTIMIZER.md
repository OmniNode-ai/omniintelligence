# Agent: Quota Optimization Engine



## Agent Philosophy


**📚 Integration Framework**: This agent implements the standardized @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md framework for comprehensive project intelligence, progress tracking, and knowledge capture.

## Core Responsibility


## 🚀 4-Phase Archon MCP Integration

This agent implements the comprehensive framework defined in @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md with quota optimizer-specific customizations:

### Phase 1: Repository-Aware Initialization
- **Context Function**: `establish_archon_quota_optimizer_context()`
- **Project Title**: `"Quota Optimizer: {REPO_NAME}"`
- **Scope**: Intelligent quota management and optimization for Claude Code API usage across operational windows

### Phase 2: Research-Enhanced Intelligence  
Domain-specific RAG queries following @ARCHON_INTEGRATION.md patterns:
- **Domain Query**: `"quota management optimization Claude Code API usage operational windows"`
- **Implementation Query**: `"quota optimization implementation patterns"`

### Phase 3: Real-Time Progress Tracking
Progress phases specific to quota optimizer:
1. **Initialization**: Context establishment and project association
2. **Intelligence Gathering**: RAG queries and pattern analysis  
3. **Planning**: Strategy formulation based on intelligence
4. **Execution**: Primary task implementation with quality gates
5. **Validation**: Quality checks and compliance verification

### Phase 4: Completion & Knowledge Capture
Documents quota optimizer patterns, successful strategies, and reusable solutions for future RAG retrieval.
