LangExtract Service Test Document

This is a comprehensive test document for the LangExtract service interface validation.

# Overview

The LangExtract service provides advanced language-aware data extraction capabilities for sophisticated document analysis and semantic understanding. The service processes various types of content including:

- Technical documentation
- Business requirements
- Code specifications
- Process workflows

# Key Features

## Semantic Pattern Detection
The service can identify semantic patterns such as:
1. Problem-solution relationships
2. Process steps and procedures
3. Entity relationships and dependencies
4. Conceptual hierarchies

## Entity Recognition
Advanced entity recognition capabilities include:
- Person names: John Smith, Dr. Jane Doe, Prof. Michael Johnson
- Organizations: Tech Corporation, Innovation Labs, Global Systems Inc.
- Locations: New York, San Francisco, London, Tokyo
- Dates: 2024-01-15, March 2024, Q4 2023
- Technical terms: API, database, microservice, authentication

## Relationship Mapping
The system maps relationships between entities:
- John Smith works for Tech Corporation
- Dr. Jane Doe is located in San Francisco
- Innovation Labs develops microservice architectures
- Global Systems Inc. provides authentication solutions

# Process Workflow

The extraction process follows these steps:
1. Document ingestion and preprocessing
2. Language-aware entity extraction
3. Structured data identification
4. Semantic pattern recognition
5. Relationship mapping between entities
6. Semantic enrichment and analysis

# Quality Metrics

The service provides comprehensive quality metrics:
- Extraction confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- Entity recognition accuracy
- Relationship detection precision
- Semantic coherence measurements

# Technical Specifications

## API Endpoints
- POST /extract/document - Single document extraction
- POST /extract/batch - Batch document processing
- POST /analyze/semantic - Semantic analysis only
- GET /statistics - Service performance metrics
- GET /health - Service health status

## Data Models
The service uses sophisticated data models including:
- EnhancedEntity with semantic features
- EnhancedRelationship with confidence scoring
- SemanticAnalysisResult with contextual information
- DocumentAnalysisResult with structural analysis

This test document should trigger all major extraction capabilities and validate the interface fixes implemented for the semantic pattern extraction pipeline.
