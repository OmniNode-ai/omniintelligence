"""Precheck for the OCC born-path manual replay entrypoint (OMN-14993).

`call-occ-autobind.yml` and `call-occ-companion-effect.yml` gained a
`workflow_dispatch` trigger so an operator can manually re-request a
machine mint for a PR whose original `pull_request` event was swallowed
(live incident: the pre-fix 422 bug in `node_occ_companion_effect`,
OMN-14981/OMN-14939). That entrypoint only works for a PR that is
currently OPEN and non-draft.

The downstream `node_occ_companion_compute` handler
(`handler_occ_companion_compute.py`, F-17 guard,
`_SUPPRESS_PR_STATES = {"closed", "merged"}` plus a separate draft check)
DELIBERATELY refuses to author a companion for a closed/merged/draft PR --
this guard was added after incident occ#4333 (a companion generated for a
closed draft). It is not a missing trigger type; it is intentional business
logic several hops downstream of this workflow, on the other side of a Kafka
publish. If the manual-dispatch entrypoint published for a merged PR anyway,
the request would be silently absorbed by that guard with `no_op_reason`
logged deep in the compute node and zero visible signal on the GitHub side --
exactly the vacuous-green failure class OMN-14993 exists to avoid.

This script is the fail-loud precheck: it runs BEFORE the publish step, reads
the same live PR state (`state`, `isDraft`) the operator would otherwise have
to know to check by hand, and refuses with an explicit, actionable message
instead of letting the request travel to the bus only to vanish.

Merged/closed-PR replay is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this entrypoint (see
OMN-14993, OMN-14991 Recommendation 4) -- making it work would require a new,
deliberately-scoped override of F-17 in `handler_occ_companion_compute.py`,
which is real design work, not a workflow trigger change.
