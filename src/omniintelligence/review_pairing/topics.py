"""Kafka topic registry for the Review-Fix Pairing subsystem.

All topic names follow the ONEX canonical format::

    onex.{kind}.{producer}.{event-name}.v{n}

where:
    kind     — ``evt`` for domain events, ``cmd`` for commands
    producer — ``review-pairing`` for this subsystem
    event-name — kebab-case event name
    n        — integer version

This module is the single source of truth for Review-Fix Pairing topic names.
No hardcoded topic strings should appear in producer or consumer code; use
these enum values instead.

Topics:
    FINDING_OBSERVED  — A review finding was captured from any review source.
    FIX_APPLIED       — A fix commit was applied for a known finding.
    FINDING_RESOLVED  — A finding disappearance was confirmed post-fix.
    PAIR_CREATED      — A confidence-scored finding-fix pair was created.
