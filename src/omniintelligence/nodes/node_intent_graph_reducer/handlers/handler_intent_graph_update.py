"""Pure graph update handlers for the Intent Graph Reducer.

Implements transition accumulation logic for the directed intent graph.
Each handler is a pure function: (graph_state, event_data) -> None
(mutations are applied in-place on the mutable graph state).

Two event types drive graph updates:

1. Intent Classification events — update node occurrence counts and detect
   transitions (when the same session classifies two sequential intents).

2. Outcome Label events — update node and edge success rates after a session
   is labeled as succeeded or failed.

Design:
    - Config-table-driven: no hardcoded class conditionals
    - Pure functions (no I/O, no logging, no side effects beyond state mutation)
    - Deterministic: same input sequence always produces same graph state

ONEX Compliance:
    - No try/except at this level — errors propagate to the orchestrating handler
    - Pure computation, no logging
