# Node type
node_type: "EFFECT_GENERIC"

# Status
status: "active"

# Description
description: >
  Effect node for persisting learned patterns to storage. Receives pattern-learned events from the pattern
  learning pipeline, validates patterns, and persists them to the pattern store. Supports pattern promotion
  from candidate to active status based on confidence thresholds and validation criteria. Emits pattern-stored
  events for successful persistence and pattern-promoted events when patterns are promoted to active status.

# Strongly typed I/O models
input_model:
  name: "ModelPatternStorageInput"
  module: "omniintelligence.nodes.node_pattern_storage_effect.models"
  description: "Input model containing learned pattern data for storage operations."

# Output model routing:
#   - store_pattern operation  -> ModelPatternStoredEvent (pattern-stored.v1)
#   - promote_pattern operation -> ModelPatternPromotedEvent (pattern-promoted.v1)
# The primary output_model is ModelPatternStoredEvent (default handler).
# See io_operations and publish_topic_metadata for operation-specific schemas.

# =============================================================================
# HANDLER ROUTING (Operation-Based Dispatch)
# =============================================================================
# Routes operations based on the storage action type. Implements two main
# operations: store (persist new patterns) and promote (upgrade candidate
# patterns to active status).
#
# Execution Flow:
#   1. Receive ModelPatternStorageInput from Kafka event
#   2. Validate pattern data and storage requirements
#   3. Route to appropriate handler (store or promote)
#   4. Persist to pattern store
#   5. Emit appropriate result event to Kafka:
#      - store_pattern  -> ModelPatternStoredEvent (pattern-stored.v1)
#      - promote_pattern -> ModelPatternPromotedEvent (pattern-promoted.v1)
#   6. Return operation-specific output model

# PUBLISHED EVENTS (Kafka) - Documentation Layer
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE: Human-readable documentation of WHAT events this node produces.
#
# This section provides rich metadata for:
#   - IntentTypeExtractor (capability inference)
#   - Contract validation and diff computation
#   - Human understanding of node behavior
#
# Contains: event_type, trigger conditions, descriptions, full topic patterns.
#
# NOTE: This is intentionally separate from event_bus (below) which handles
# WHERE events are routed. Both are needed for Effect nodes:
#   - published_events = documentation layer (WHAT)
#   - event_bus = runtime routing layer (WHERE)
#
# Topic naming: onex.{kind}[.{producer}].{event-name}.v{n}
#   - kind=cmd for commands/inputs
#   - kind=evt for events/outputs
#   - {producer} segment: REQUIRED for internal single-producer topics
#     (e.g., onex.evt.omniintelligence.pattern-learned.v1)
#     Use when events originate from a single known service.
#   - {producer} segment: OMITTED for multi-producer business events
#     (e.g., onex.evt.pattern.discovered.v1)
#     Use when events come from multiple external systems or are domain-level
#     events that cross service boundaries.

# EVENT BUS SUBCONTRACT - Runtime Routing Layer
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE: Machine-readable configuration of WHERE events are routed.

#   - Kafka topic subscription/publication
#   - Schema validation via topic metadata
#
# Contains: topic suffixes (simple strings) + optional schema references.
#

# documents WHAT events this node produces. Both are needed for Effect nodes:
#   - published_events = documentation layer (WHAT)
#   - event_bus = runtime routing layer (WHERE)
#
# Added by OMN-1668 for pattern storage event handling.
