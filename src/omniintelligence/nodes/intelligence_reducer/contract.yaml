# ONEX Node Contract - Intelligence Reducer Node
#
# This reducer follows the pure function pattern for intelligence workflows:
#   reduce(state, event) -> ModelReducerOutput[state + intents]
#
# The FSM defines state transitions for three workflow types:
#   - INGESTION: Document ingestion lifecycle
#   - PATTERN_LEARNING: 4-phase pattern learning
#   - QUALITY_ASSESSMENT: Quality scoring lifecycle
#
# All state is stored in PostgreSQL fsm_state table.
# All state transition logic is driven by this contract.

  Unified reducer for all intelligence FSMs. Pure reducer with all state stored in PostgreSQL fsm_state
  table. Handles INGESTION, PATTERN_LEARNING, and QUALITY_ASSESSMENT FSM types via enum routing.

# FSM State Machine Definition
# ============================
# The intelligence reducer manages three FSM types, each with its own state machine.
# This section defines the INGESTION FSM as the primary example.
# All FSMs follow the pattern: (state, event) -> (new_state, intents)
