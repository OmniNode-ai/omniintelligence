# Pre-commit hooks for omniintelligence
# Install: pre-commit install
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
#
# Hook Scope Summary:
# - yamlfmt: YAML formatting for consistency
# - pre-commit-hooks: File hygiene (trailing whitespace, EOF, merge conflicts)
# - ruff/mypy: All production Python code (tools/, utils/, runtime/) and their tests
# - contract-linter: ONEX node contracts (future nodes/ directory)
# - pytest-smoke: Quick unit tests on commit
# - pytest-tools: Full tools tests on push only
#
# Global Exclusions (excluded from ALL hooks via exclude: block at bottom):
# - _legacy/: Legacy code preserved for migration reference
# - migration_sources/: Original omniarchon source code
# - .git/: Git internals
#
# Per-Hook Exclusions (excluded from specific hooks only):
# - .github/workflows/: Excluded from formatting hooks (yamlfmt, trailing-whitespace,
#   end-of-file-fixer) because GitHub Actions workflows have specific YAML syntax
#   requirements (expression syntax ${{ }}, multiline strings, run blocks) that
#   conflict with standard formatting rules. NOT excluded from check-merge-conflict
#   or check-added-large-files since those validations remain useful.
#
# Performance Optimizations:
# - fail_fast: true - Stop on first failure to save time during development
# - types: [python] - Faster than regex patterns for type-based filtering
# - Hook ordering: Fast hooks (file hygiene) run before slow hooks (mypy, pytest)
# - require_serial: false (default) - Allow parallel execution where possible

# Stop on first failure to avoid wasted hook runs during development
fail_fast: true
