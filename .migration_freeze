# Migration Freeze
#
# This file enforces a schema freeze during the DB-per-repo refactor (OMN-2055).
# While this file exists, no new migrations may be added to deployment/database/migrations/.
#
# Allowed during freeze:
#   - Migration moves (reorg between repos)
#   - Ownership fixes (table transfers)
#   - Rollback bug fixes (DB-SPLIT-01 refactor phase)
#
# To lift the freeze: remove this file once DB boundary work for omniintelligence is complete.
#
# Enforcement: CI job (migration-freeze) + pre-commit hook (migration-freeze-check)
# Tracking: OMN-2072
# Parent:   OMN-2055
# Created:  2026-02-10
