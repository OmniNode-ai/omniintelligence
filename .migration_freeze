# Migration Freeze
#
# This file enforces a schema freeze during the DB-per-repo refactor (OMN-2055).
# While this file exists, no new migrations may be added to deployment/database/migrations/.
#
# Allowed during freeze:
#   - Migration moves (reorg between repos)
#   - Ownership fixes (table transfers)
#   - Rollback bug fixes (DB-SPLIT-01)
#
# To lift the freeze: remove this file once DB boundary work for omniintelligence is complete.
